track_thresh : 0.5
#  {0,1} - confidence threshold for detections to be included in tracking
# 
high_thresh : 0.4
#  {0,1} - confidence threshold for high confidence detections
# 
match_thresh : 0.9
#  {0,1} - matching threshold for tracking - higher values indicates minimum ID switches, lower values may have ID switching

frame_rate : 20
#  frame-rate for tracking
# 
track_buffer : 120
#  number of frames for which a track should be kept in memory if the track is lost.
# 
NMS_thresh : 0.7
#  {0,1} Non-Maximal-Suppression threshold for the detector - to avoid multiple detections for a single person
#
